# Reading: Advanced State with Reducers

```js 
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

<br/>

- An alternative to `useState`. Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a `dispatch` method.
<br/>


- `useReducer` is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## How does useReducer work?
 - `useReducer` is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Code example : 

```js
const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Specifying the initial state:

- The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument:


```js
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
);
```

<br/>
<br/>

# Review: 

## How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

- Add a second parameter to the effect hook; Example
```js
function App() {

  useEffect(() => {
  // Run! Like go get some data from an API.
}, []);
}
```
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


## Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?
- we could do one setState call and there will only be one render. Unlike the setState in class components, the setState returned from useState doesnâ€™t merge objects with the existing state, it replaces the object entirely.

<br/>
<br/>



## Is useState() synchronous?

- useState and setState both are asynchronous.Even though they are asynchronous, the useState and setState functions do not return promises.Therefore we cannot attach a then handler to it or use async/await to get the updated state values.

# Definitions:

- State Hook: The state is an instance of React Component can be defined as an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component. In other words, the State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component.
<br/>

- Component Lifecycle: Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own, lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component's existence. Mounting: Mounting is the stage of rendering the JSX returned by the render method itself.
